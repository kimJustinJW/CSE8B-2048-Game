 * 1. In vim, you use the :%s/search/replace/g command to find and 
 * replace every instance of the word fun with amazing. You would 
 * use :s/search/replace/. 
 * 2. You can use "mkdir -p myProject/{src,directory/{fooDir,barDir},
 * tools,db}".
 * 3. If you use javac *.java in a directory, it will compile all java
 * files in the directory. Essentially wildcard characters are shortcuts.
 * 4. You would use "gvim -p *.c".
 * 5. A static method can be accessed without a calling object; all it would
 * need is the classname. Essentially you don't need an object of the static
 * method's associated class to call it. For example, you can use the Math
 * class's methods to perform mathemetical functions without having to
 * create Math objects inside of your current class and without having to
 * use Math objects to call the Math class's methods.
 * 6. The student can create different classes for the shapes that determine
 * different characteristics and import the Color class into her ShapeDrawer
 * and use the colors as parameters for a universal draw() method.
